# MonteCarlo-Option-Pricing


#### Overview
In this script I calculated the price and greeks of a European Down-and-Out barrier option using Monte Carlo simulations. The greeks are obtained by finited difference method.
I compared the results to the analytic calculations of the price and greeks.

In this example I used a strike price of h<sub>&theta;</sub>(x) = &theta;<sub>o</sub> x + &theta;<sub>1</sub>x. 

#### Discussion
In order to obtain a good estimate of the exact price and in particular the greeks, one needs to run
